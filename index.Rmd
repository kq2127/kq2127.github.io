# About me
     The research I work on is most closely realted to blood pressure and how we can best measure blood pressure in clinical and non clinical settings. 
    The blood pressure devices I am currently using are the ABPM and HBPM monitors developed by Microlife, the ABPM monitor developed by Spacelabs, and the OMRON device. You can learn more about my professional and educational backgroud [here](Resume.html)
